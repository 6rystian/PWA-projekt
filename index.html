        <div class="imgkts3"></div>
        <p>Third and last installment of experimental series "Kill the Sun". This EP drifts away from the typical alternative rap sounds, as it has been majorly influenced by indie pop/rock and most songs can be put somewhere around these subgenres. </p>

        <h2>Lost in Time (2019)</h2>
        <div class="imglit"></div>
        <p>First fully self-produced project. The concept of the EP is that all of the melodies besides the outro were first created in the first months of 2016, to be specifically selected and re-produced 3 years later for the purpose of this project.</p>

    <div class="kvr">
        <h2>Nothing (2018)</h2>
        <div class="imgnothing"></div>
        <p>First full-length album by kVr and his second ever after 2015's "Mic Check EP". Written in 2016 and recorded in 2017, this is still the most important project in the discography, showing the growth as an artist and as a person within the few years that had passed since the early days of kVr's adventure with music, as much as it was needed as an outlet for personal struggles of growing up as a turbulent teenager. The album has 14 concept-core tracks and 4 bonus tracks, three from each being the first self-produced songs released.</p>
        <p><br>Released: November 25, 2018<br><br>
            Producers: kVr, Contrary, Yes Beatz, JurdBeats, NoCredit, BruceWayne, 
            FiFtY VinC, SimpTunes, Beatfella, T.M.Vermehren<br><br>
